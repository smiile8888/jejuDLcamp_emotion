<p>
I want to make the chatting messenger which recognize user's emotion and displays it in colors.<br/>
This is the code about a demo web page that briefly covered this concept. <br/>

## Text to Emoji

<p>
I use the DeepMoji model from MIT media lab as emotion classifier.<br/>
It is trained by 1246 million tweets, which is containing one of 64 different common emoticon.<br/>
There are embedding layer to project each word into a vector space. <br/>
( a hyper tangent activation enforce a constraint of each embedding dimension being within -1~1. )<br/>
two bidirectional LSTM layers to capture the context of each word.<br/>
And an attention layer that lets the model decide the importance of each word for the prediction.<br/>

## Emoji to Color

<p>
I mapping color based on dendrogram.<br/> 
The dendrogram shows how the model learns to group emojis based on emotional content.<br/> 
The y-axis is the distance on the correlation matrix of the modelâ€™s predictions.<br/>
 t measured using average linkage.

<p>
The color code I use is rgba. (a = defines the opacity.)<br/>
The output from the model is the probability of each 64 different emojis.<br/>
I use top 3 probability with normalization for define the opacity of layer.<br/>
And this 3 layers are overlaped, and than determind the color of screen.<br/>
In this way I represent the emotion by color.<br/>
